										<h4 class="mt-4 lead-two">WHAT IS REFLECTIVE PRACTICE</h4>
										<p class="lead">
											Reflective practice is the process of examining and
											evaluating one’s day-to-day activities and experiences
											with an open mind. It is an active process of analyzing
											one’s own practice to identify strengths, weaknesses, and
											areas for improvement. As Schön (1983) explains,
											reflection allows practitioners to learn from their
											experiences and devise strategies to enhance their work.
										</p>
										<p class="lead">
											In teaching, reflective practice involves looking back at
											teaching experiences, analyzing what worked and what
											didn’t, and using these insights to improve future
											practice. It is a powerful tool for professional growth,
											enabling teachers to adapt their methods to better meet
											the needs of their students.

											WHO IS A REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER?
										</h4>
										<p class="lead">
											A reflective practitioner is someone who actively examines
											past and present experiences to guide future actions and
											improve professional practice. Reflection is a vital part
											of personal and professional development, as it fosters
											self-awareness and continuous improvement. As Plato
											famously said, “The un-reflected life is not worth
											living.” This principle applies to teaching, where
											reflection helps educators grow and refine their craft.

										<!-- ===== How I Reflect On My Practice Start ===== -->
										<h4 class="mt-4 lead-two">HOW I REFLECT</h4>
										<p>
											Reflection in teaching involves a structured process of
											self-evaluation. I follow these four steps to reflect on
											my teaching experiences:
										</p>

										<p class="lead">
											<ol>
												<li>
													<strong>Description of the Event</strong><br />
													I begin by describing the teaching experience in
													detail. I ask myself:
													<ul>
														<li>What was I trying to achieve?</li>
														<li>What did I do?</li>
														<li>
															What were the effects of my actions (or
															inactions)?
														</li>
													</ul>
												</li>

												<li>
													<strong><span>Analysis and Interpretation of the Event</span></strong> <br>
													Next, I analyze why things happened the way they did. I consider:
													<ul>Why did I choose to act the way I did?</ul>
													<ul>How did my actions align with my beliefs?</ul>
													<ul>How did the context influence the experience?</ul>
													<ul>What did I do effectively?</ul>
												</li>

												<li>
													<strong>Meaning and Application</strong><br />
													I then reflect on the overall meaning of the event and its
													implications for my teaching. I ask:
													<ul>
														<li>What were the strengths of the lesson?</li>
														<li>What could I have done differently?</li>
														<li>Where do I need improvement?</li>
														<li>What have I learned from this experience?</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>
													<strong>Implications for Action</strong><br />
													Finally, I use my reflections to plan for future improvement. I
													consider:
													<ul>
														<li>What will I do differently next time?</li>
														<li>
															How can I modify my teaching to better support student
															learning?
														</li>
														<li>
															What resources or support do I need to implement these
															changes?
														</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ol>
