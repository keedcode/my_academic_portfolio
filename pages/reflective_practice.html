					<h2>What is Reflective Practice?</h2>
					<p>
						Reflective practice is the process of examining and evaluating one’s
						day-to-day activities and experiences with an open mind. It is an
						active process of analyzing one’s own practice to identify
						strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. As Schön (1983)
						explains, reflection allows practitioners to learn from their
						experiences and devise strategies to enhance their work.
					</p>
					<p>
						In teaching, reflective practice involves looking back at teaching
						experiences, analyzing what worked and what didn’t, and using these
						insights to improve future practice. It is a powerful tool for
						professional growth, enabling teachers to adapt their methods to
						better meet the needs of their students.
					</p>

					<h2>Who is a Reflective Practitioner?</h2>
					<p>
						A reflective practitioner is someone who actively examines past and
						present experiences to guide future actions and improve professional
						practice. Reflection is a vital part of personal and professional
						development, as it fosters self-awareness and continuous
						improvement. As Plato famously said,
						<em>“The un-reflected life is not worth living.”</em> This principle
						applies to teaching, where reflection helps educators grow and
						refine their craft.
					</p>

					<h2>How I Reflect on My Practice</h2>
					<p>
						Reflection in teaching involves a structured process of
						self-evaluation. I follow these four steps to reflect on my teaching
						experiences:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Description of the Event</strong><br />
							I begin by describing the teaching experience in detail. I ask
							myself:
							<ul>
								<li>What was I trying to achieve?</li>
								<li>What did I do?</li>
								<li>What were the effects of my actions (or inactions)?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Analysis and Interpretation of the Event</strong><br />
							Next, I analyze why things happened the way they did. I consider:
							<ul>
								<li>Why did I choose to act the way I did?</li>
								<li>How did my actions align with my beliefs?</li>
								<li>How did the context influence the experience?</li>
								<li>What did I do effectively?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Meaning and Application</strong><br />
							I then reflect on the overall meaning of the event and its
							implications for my teaching. I ask:
							<ul>
								<li>What were the strengths of the lesson?</li>
								<li>What could I have done differently?</li>
								<li>Where do I need improvement?</li>
								<li>What have I learned from this experience?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Implications for Action</strong><br />
							Finally, I use my reflections to plan for future improvement. I
							consider:
							<ul>
								<li>What will I do differently next time?</li>
								<li>
									How can I modify my teaching to better support student
									learning?
								</li>
								<li>
									What resources or support do I need to implement these
									changes?
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Reflective Practice in My Teaching</h2>
					<p>
						Reflective practice is a cornerstone of my teaching philosophy.
						After each lesson, I take time to reflect on what worked well and
						what could be improved. For example:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If a lesson did not engage students as expected, I analyze whether
							the content, delivery, or activities need adjustment.
						</li>
						<li>
							If students excelled in a particular activity, I explore how to
							incorporate similar strategies in future lessons.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Through reflection, I continuously refine my teaching methods to
						create a more effective and inclusive learning environment. This
						process not only enhances my professional practice but also ensures
						that my students receive the best possible education.
